		<h3>Midnight Cookies is Gainesville's very own.</h3>
		<h4>We are locally owned, created, and operated. We offer delivery to most of Gainesville, and we bake your cookies fresh to order when you crave them the most.</h4>
		<h4>So don't bother bringing out the flour and teaspoons (and don't worry about figuring out the difference between baking powder and baking soda). </h4>
		<h4>We got this.</h4>

		<p>Through many many MANY batches of testing, there's one thing we've learned: <strong>Fresh cookies taste really, really good.</strong></p>

		<p>There is no comparison as to how delicious a cookie is when it's fresh, still a bit warm so that it melts in your mouth.</p>

		<p>So we decided to open up Midnight Cookies. We're not your standard bakery, baking endless amount of desserts and breads overnight, hoping to sell them throughout the day. You order, we bake, we deliver, you eat.</p>

		<h3>How fresh is fresh baked?</h3>
		<p>We start with making our very own dough with a little ol' Kitchen Aid Mixer (or two, or three...) from our very own recipes. Other places often use pre-made and sometimes frozen dough.  Maybe they add a "super unique topping" and call it "original," but don't let them fool you. We start with butter and sugar (sometimes vegetable shortening for vegan doughs). And then we let our imaginations run wild. We've got a core number of delicious flavors, but we sometimes like to go outside the cookie box, having created well over 60 flavors throughout the years. After our cookie shaping machines (known as our Awesome Kitchen Staff) carefully portion our dough, we wait until you order.  Only <em>then</em> do we pop the delicious creations into the oven. Then we serve them up to you. Or often our delivery drivers bring them straight to you. Nice and gooey, still a bit warm.</p>

		<h3>The Cookies</h3>
		<p>We feature a regularly changing menu, loaded with traditional ones such as Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal Raisin, then we take a creative leap and introduce you to our crazy minds. Peanut Butter cookies are great, but try it with some sliced bananas?  How about some jelly on top?</p>

		<p>The sad thing is, like we said, we change our menu regularly.  So some cookies are available only for a short time and won't be back 'til the next year.</p>

		<p>So yes, you may have to wait for a little while, but we assure you that your mouths will appreciate the experience of a fresh-baked (not "We bake it at 6 AM and sell them all day”) cookie, with an array of flavors you never thought possible within a cookie.</p>

		<p>Our aim is to change the way you eat cookies. Don't treat it as a dime-a-dozen factory-made "1 million chips in every bag!" stale snack.  View it as a warm, melt-in-your-mouth dessert, that you can't experience anywhere else.</p>
