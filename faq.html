		<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

		<h3>How do I order?</h3>
		<p>Call us at <strong>352-371-3535</strong> or take a seat at our store while we bake your cookies! We are located at 3345 SW 34th St, just south of Archer Rd. on 34th St, right before you hit 35th Place. It's the same plaza area that has Carraba's, Peach Valley Cafe, and World of Beer, and we are a couple stores down from Tropical Smoothie Cafe.</p>
		<p>You can ordering any number of any kind of cookies. For example, you can order 12 sugar cookies, or 3 of one kind and 5 of another, or you can order one of every cookie available.</p>
		<ul><h3>Information you should have ready before ordering:</h3>
			<li>Phone number (the number we can best contact you at)</li>
			<li>Address</li>
			<li>Gate codes (if applicable, and please mention this after giving your address)</li>
			<li>Credit Card information</li>
			<li>PLEASE KEEP YOUR PHONE ON YOU AND OFF SILENT AFTER PLACING YOUR ORDER.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How long until I can get my cookies?</h3>
		<p>For take out/dine-in orders, remember that we bake all cookies fresh to order, and this can take anywhere from 10-25 minutes, depending on how busy we are. We strongly recommend that you call <strong>(352-371-3535)</strong> to place a pick-up order so we can have your cookies ready when you get there. Delivery time can range from 25 minutes up to an hour, or more, depending on how busy we are at the time of ordering.</p>

		<h3>How do I pay?</h3>
		<p>To be eligible for delivery, the minimum amount to order is $8.00 (before tax and delivery charge).</p>
		<p class="menuItem">So, if you're only ordering cookies, six would meet the minimum. Five cookies and one milk or four cookies and two cups of milk work as well.</p>
		<p>The minimum amount to pay with a card for dine-in/take-out orders is $4.00.</p>
		<p class="menuItem">This would be three cookies or two cookies and a drink.</p>

		<h3>Can I split the cost with a friend?</h3>
		<p>There is a maximum of two cards per order/address, and each card must be run for a minimum of $5. To use more than two cards, you'd have to place a separate order that would have its own $8 minimum as well as its own delivery charge.</p>

		<h3>Delivery fees and tips</h3>
		<p>There is a $2.75 charge for all deliveries. Please note this helps to cover general overhead costs and is not a tip for the driver.</p>
		<p>We recommend $2 - $3 as being a standard tip for delivery drivers. For larger orders, or orders in which the driver must make extra effort (such as running through the rain, or let's say you have your phone on silent and the driver spends 5 - 10 minutes trying to get ahold of you), tipping a little more is encouraged and greatly appreciated. </p>
		<p>A tip of $4 - 6 is suggested for locations outside our delivery area. For places located very well outside our delivery area, an automatic gratuity of at least $5 may be added.</p>

		<h3>How far away do you deliver?</h3>
		<p class="menuItem">We will take orders outside our delivery area <em>sometimes</em>...</p>
		<p>But it depends on how busy we are, how many drivers we have available, and where exactly the delivery is going. Please understand that if we do make an exception one time, that we may not be able to do so again on a future order, depending on those factors.</p>
		<p>The order usually must exceed a higher minimum order, usually $16 before tax/delivery charge, sometimes higher.</p>
		<p>There is an extra out-of-area fee that ranges from $0.50  - $1.50 (more if it is much further out of area).</p>

		<h3>How do you make your vegan cookies?</h3>
		<p>Our vegan cookies are both butter-less and egg-less, using vegetable shortening and soy milk (or sometimes almond milk) instead. While all ingredients in the vegan batches don't contain animal products, there is a chance of "cross contamination," both in store with cookies we bake up, and occasionally the ingredients used may not be consider vegan by those following the strictest of practices.</p>
		<p>The same concept applies to those with allergies (nut/peanut/soy/etc). When informed of allergies (or if informed of wanting fewer chances of cross-contaminating vegan options), we will take extra precautions, though can't guarantee it fully.</p>
		<p>If you have any concerns or questions regarding any of our vegan cookies, please feel free to <a href="mailto:midnightcookiesgainesville@gmail.com">email us!</a></p>

		<h3>What if my order is wrong or I miss your phone call?</h3>
		<p>There may be a $3.50 re-delivery fee to have orders re-sent out.</p>
		<p>If our driver cannot get ahold of you (if no one answers the door and you don't pick up the phone), and has to return to the store with your order, you may be charged an extra $3.50 to have it sent back out.  So PLEASE keep your phone on you and make sure it is off silent! If you get poor cell phone reception, please inform us when placing your order or provide us with an alternate number (such as a roommate’s). Oftentimes if we experience trouble reaching you on more than one occasion, we may stop delivering to you or may require you to pay with a credit card with the understanding that if we cannot get ahold of you yet again, then you will not be issued a refund.</p>

		<h3>How can I send cookies to a friend? (Gift Orders)</h3>
		<p>Due to the extra details needed, as well as the process we must take to set up orders being delivered to someone else as a gift, we ask that you call by 7:30 PM to set up an order being delivered as a gift that night.</p>
		<p>Taking gift orders takes significantly more time, and remember that we aren't your typical bakery where we stand around waiting to sell our cookies that we baked last night.</p>
		<ul>
			<h3>To place a gift order, you will need to provide... </h3>
			<li>Your name and phone number</li>
			<li>Recipient's name and phone number</li>
			<li>Recipient's address (name of dorm is all we need for campus orders, not the full address)</li>
			<li>Your full credit card number and expiration date, as well an billing zip code. Sometimes we may ask to provide a full billing address and/or that three-digit security code on the back of the card. We currently do not accept American Express cards for gift orders.</li>
			<li><strong>A preferred time slot. We offer two choices:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>6 - 10 PM and 10 PM - close</li>
					<li>On Sundays, we offer 3 - 9 PM, and 9 PM - close</li>
					<li>On Saturday, we also offer 3 - 6 PM</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you call after 7:30 PM, there is a chance that we would not be able to make the first time slot. If you call after 10 PM, please note that, because of the limited amount of time available, if we cannot get ahold of the recipient, no refunds can be issued and the delivery will be pushed back to the next business day.</p>

		<ul><h3>What if I need cookies delivered at a certain time?</h3></ul>
		<p>If you have a more specific time frame, we will try our best to accommodate but cannot guarantee it;  it all depends on how busy we are at any given time and where other deliveries are going to (and when we are able to get in contact with the recipient).</p>
		<p>If the recipient is looking for a more specific time slot, we ask that you have them call us directly 30 minutes to an hour prior to the desired time (so if they want it around 8 PM, tell them to call us at 7:30 for a 8 - 8:30 arrival). Just have them tell us that an order was placed as a gift for them!</p>
		<p><strong>We will call the recipient prior to making and delivering the order and must establish contact prior to making and sending out the order.</strong> This is to ensure our driver can successfully make the delivery. As much as you can "assure" us that the recipient is there, you never know if he or she may decide to step out and go somewhere else for a while.</p>
		<p>Plus, for many places (campus, gated complexes, and locations where parking is limited), the driver must call the recipient to meet them outside.  If the recipient doesn't pick up his or her phone, we can't make the delivery.</p>
		<p>If we are unable to make the delivery and we were not informed that it was going to someone else, there will be a $3.50 re-delivery fee to have it sent back out (And there would be an additional charge if you request to have the order baked again).  If we made the order and sent a driver out to the location only to have them return, there will be no refund.</p>
		<p>We are available to deliver earlier/outside business hours, but we must have 48 hours notice and it would be subject to a higher delivery charge, minimum order amount, and an automatic minimum gratuity (typically ends up being a total minimum charge of $35 - $45).</p>
		<p>If we are unable to get in contact with the recipient, we will attempt to contact them the next business day.</p>

		<ul><h3>"But I want it to be a surprise!"</h3></ul>
		<p>We assure you that, even when we call them, it is still a surprise and they are just as happy.</p>
		<ul><h3>”I really don't want you to call them!"</h3></ul>
		<p>Unfortunately, it is our policy.  Remember, we aren't like a flower shop where we'll have a smaller number of orders placed days in advance.  We're constantly getting orders in throughout the night for immediate delivery. Timing is very important in food delivery business, and things such as someone not answering the door or phone can throw it off significantly.</p>
		<ul><h3>"PLEEEEASE!"</h3></ul>
		<p>Also keep in mind that we are a late-night business.  If someone came knocking at your door at 1 AM, wouldn't you be a little suspicious and cautious?  We've had numerous instances in which it's obvious someone is home, but they don't answer because they don't know who it is and aren't expecting anyone.</p>
		<p class="menuItem">Suggested Gratuity For Gift Orders</p>
		<p class="menuItem">(note: for orders outside our delivery area or outside normal business hours, a minimum mandatory gratuity will be added of $4 - $10)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>$3 for orders up to $20</li>
			<li>$4 for orders $20 - $25</li>
			<li>$5 for orders $25 - $30</li>
			<li>$6 for orders over $30</li>
		</ul>
