## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
- Plugins: Hamburger menu navigation (under 600px) and Facebook plugin.
	- *Note: Since the FB plugin is provided by the social media platform, I was unable to edit its appearance and used some "hacks" to get it to respond. While it works, some of the code insists on a FB developer code which is only available to the business.*
- Custom JS: insert Facebook message "Last orders taken 15 min before close" (.sideNote) into Social div using JS only. Can be seen on every page under hours/contact information.
- Custom jQuery: Add "Limited Time" to featured cookies on mouseenter (only the one selected, indicated by "this"), then remove it on mouseleave.
- Other requirements
	- *Since this website is for a real business, I adjusted the requirements to meet what is already available!*
	- Upcoming events: Hours and holiday specials updated via Facebook plugin on index/homepage.
	- Ongoing promotions: Featured cookie flavors indicated by yellow text and *Limited Time* JavaScript on index/homepage.
	- Gift certificate information: Gift ordering info available on FAQ page.
